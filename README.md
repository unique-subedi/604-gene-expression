## Workflow

1. Make a copy of the master notebook and save a copy of a notebook indexed by your name.

2. Make your changes and push your notebook to github. In colab, you can click *File --> Save a copy in Github* to save the notebook directly to the repo of your choice.

3. At the end, we can merge all usable code into the master notebook for the report or presentation.
