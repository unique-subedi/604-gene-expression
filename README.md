# gene-expression

The goal of this project is to study the effect of sex (male vs females) and brain region (anterior cortex vs dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) on gene expression. The dataset we use is from GEO (GSE2164), and a full description of the dataset can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2164).
